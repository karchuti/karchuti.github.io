                    <h3>Website coded from scratch</h3>
                    <p>Dissertation Project</p>

                    <p>For my dissertation project, I meticulously developed a website from the ground up, focusing on
                        accessibility, usability, and informativeness.</p>

                    <p>Adhering closely to the WCAG guidelines and employing best coding practices, the website boasts
                        exceptional accessibility. It incorporates essential features such as descriptive alt text for
                        images, a meticulously structured hierarchy facilitating keyboard navigation, and carefully
                        chosen color contrasts to accommodate individuals with varying visual abilities.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, I meticulously designed the layout, navigation, and interactive elements based on UX
                        principles, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>

                    <p>The inspiration behind the website's informative nature stems from the observation of the lack of
                        clear documentation and abundant data on Datacenters. Hence, my aim was to bridge this knowledge
                        gap in the most user-friendly manner possible.</p>

                <h1>Methodology</h1>

                <h2>Agile vs. DevOps</h2>
                <p>“Agile and DevOps” (Understanding the differences between Agile & DevSecOps - from a business
                    perspective 2023) are two methodologies that could have been used in the software development of the
                    projects, and both had their strengths and suitability. While DevOps focused on the collaboration
                    and integration of development and operations in large teams, Agile emphasizes flexibility,
                    iterative development, and continuous improvement in smaller teams. As agile “encourages changes”,
                    was better suited for small teams and shared similarities in approaches with the scientific
                    methodology especially around iteration and flexibility as seen between figure 2 and figure 3,
                    resulting in the agile methodology having suited the project better.</p>
                <p><a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/understanding_differences_agile_devsecops/"
                        target="_blank">Understanding the differences between Agile & DevSecOps - from a business
                        perspective 2023</a></p>

                <h2>Coding software</h2>
                <p>Originally Atom was used to code the webpage due to its extreme simplicity and excellent integration
                    with GitHub as it was created by them and allow quick and easy setup alongside management of
                    requests. However, due to security issues caused by a breach the software was sunset through the
                    duration of the project and an alternative had to be found. The alternate used was visual studio
                    code, like Atom it had GitHub integration although had a more complicated file structure and clutter
                    due to its multipurpose design.</p>

                <h2>Hosting</h2>
                <p>To host the finished artifact, GitHub pages was used due to its lack of cost and easy redeployment as
                    unlike the proper method of hosting it on sever with an official domain would create cost.
                    Furthermore, other hosting services such as Plesk require migrating the folders and certifying the
                    webpage to allow it to be hosted, whereas GitHub pages simply requires a repository to work which
                    was much easier to deploy and allow for continuous updating as it would update automatically from
                    the repository whereas Plesk would require re-uploading the folders.</p>

                <h2>Management</h2>
                <p>Coding tasks were kept track using a kanban board as seen in figure 8, although GitHub allowed for
                    the use of labels for tasks as seen in figure 7, merge request, pull request and so forth, a kanban
                    board was quicker and easier to deploy, maintain and adjust as having to create custom labels,
                    create the tasks and apply the labels to the tasks although making a neater and more organised
                    system would have taken up the limited time the project had.

                    For long term goals such as milestone submissions, as seen in figure 9. a Gantt chart was used as it
                    better displayed the time available due to its calendar view that spanned remaining task time across
                    dates.

                <h1>Design</h1>

                <h3>Page layout</h3>
                <p>As seen in figure 10, the page layout was kept simple with a navigation followed by a title header
                    and then the body that would one after another display the content boxes. The content boxes were
                    designed to be shuffled using different types of content boxes to prevent the page from becoming a
                    block of text.</p>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>As seen in figure 11, the idea for the navigation was to be fixed at the top for always easy access
                    as well as incorporating a search box which although redundant most of the time would allow for
                    easier access to the search function and allowed for the search function to work even if the user
                    were having issues that prevented them from having one in their browser. This could be the browser
                    not having a search function, their browser-add Ons or software blocking the search function, etc.
                    Furthermore, this search box would work differently, as the regular search function only highlighted
                    text, it would not highlight hidden text that required interaction. Therefore, the search box would
                    be designed in a way where instead of highlighting text that was hidden it would highlight the
                    content box instead.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-item second padTop">
            <div class="portfolio-description">

                <h3>Content boxes</h3>
                <p>As seen in figure 12, there were three main ideas for the content boxes, the first being a simple
                    image and text for the larger or standalone pieces of information. This type of emphasis the content
                    of the box whilst referencing an image which although not the best option it was better than just
                    plain text.

                    Another type involved an image which when hover over created an overlay with the relevant text. This
                    allow large amounts of text to be hidden de-cluttering the page of items to better adhere to the UX
                    laws of such as millers law which govern that many people can only keep track of around 7 items at a
                    time otherwise, they get confused.

                    The next content box involved the image sliding away to reveal a name or a quick description, this
                    would be rarely utilised as it would fit little text however it would work well for linking an image
                    of an item to its name to give the user better recognition of it.

                    Lastly, the idea of adding a video instead of an image came about, it would have continuous playback
                    instead of an image for some of the content.

            <div class="portfolio-description">

                <h3>Content Layout</h3>
                <p>More information was available on the internet however due to the time provided the research was
                    limited to the topics seen in figure 14 which were organized into categories that would be sectioned
                    off making it easier to search though the information.</p>

                <h3>Colour scheme</h3>
                <p>The background colour was kept white without a background image apart from the banner to provide the
                    best contrast possible to the text whose colour was kept black to best contrast the white
                    background. #4169e1 light blue accents in banner image and progress bar were used to add flair to
                    the page. #b80f0a dark red was used in the progress bar as it contrasted the blue due to being on
                    opposite on the colour wheel allowing it to transition to provide clear contrast as the user scrolls
                    down the page. #dee2e6 light white was used in the image overlays to provide better contrast for
                    text when the user hovers over.

                    the page layout if the screen size became small as it would squish the images and text. This results
                    in the adherents of laws of proximity by making the section content look like its grouped together
                    making its recognition easier.

                    The content boxes were sized using grid sizes to evenly separate most content boxes. They have their
                    own padding and margins to fit appropriately and a @media setting to collapse the grids into
                    individual rows to make the images and text fill the width of the screen to make the information
                    more readable on smaller sized screens.

                <h3>Progress bar</h3>
                <p>Due to the large amount of information on the page it was possible to easily get lost therefore a
                    progress bar was added to make it easier to indicate how far down the page the user is. Furthermore,
                    to make it clearer when the user is nearing the end of the page alongside increasing in size, the
                    colour of the bar would transition to the colour opposite itself on the colour wheel to create
                    contrast thus making a clear change.

                    The Progress bar actively monitors the scroll position of the page and updates the JS which changes
                    the size of the progress bar as the scroll position increases.

                    would reveal the list under t the navigation thus allowing for all the links to fit without spilling

                <h3>Search box</h3>
                <p>The search box was added to more easily find information on the webpage as well as working
                    differently to
                    the browser search function as the search function would not highlight text inside interactive
                    elements.
                    To perform this the JS code instead of highlighting the text would highlight its parent class with a
                    border as giving an image / content box a yellow hue due to a highlight would make the text harder
                    to
                    read when the user would interact with it.

                    The search box works by using JS to iterate through matching text that then gets highlighted. Then,
                    separately the “current highlight” code iterates to find the matches and allows the user to move
                    through
                    them whilst highlighting the current index which they’re on. This could possibly be combined with
                    the
                    previous iteration however it was easier to code this way.

                    Furthermore, currently the elements around the search function are created in the JS so that if the
                    JS
                    file doesn’t load, the function is not there cluttering the screen.

                    was hard to know when it started and ended. Therefore several this were done to combat this, firstly
                    the margins and paddings were adjusted to leave gaps and furthermore the content boxes instead of
                    being split evenly in rows were placed so that the end always had one standalone box creating a
                    downwards arrow shape that would lead to the next section or heading which would start with an even
                    row again creating subconscious for the user a clear indication of direction on the webpage.

The JS then represents this by updating dots at the bottom of the slide to indicate the position of the slide.

                <p>A big part of users not knowing off or about datacentres is due to not being able to see one for themselves which is why an iframe containing a 360 tour of a datacentre was included. Firstly, to be accessible to subtitles are automatically on. However, to prevent a scare or inconvenience to the user, the sound is automatically muted. Furthermore, the play back starts automatically in order to interest the user. Then, if the user has issue with the controls for the video, the playback is set to loop to make it easier for them. Lastly, in the mobile screen size version, the video is removed as it requires suitable controls and screen size to be usable and therefore would simply clutter the screen for those users therefore it is hidden at smaller screen sizes.
