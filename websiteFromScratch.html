                    <h3>Website coded from scratch</h3>
                    <p>Dissertation Project</p>

                    <p>For my dissertation project, I meticulously developed a website from the ground up, focusing on accessibility, usability, and informativeness.</p>

                    <p>Adhering closely to the WCAG guidelines and employing best coding practices, the website boasts exceptional accessibility. It incorporates essential features such as descriptive alt text for images, a meticulously structured hierarchy facilitating keyboard navigation, and carefully chosen color contrasts to accommodate individuals with varying visual abilities.</p>
                  
                    <p>Furthermore, I meticulously designed the layout, navigation, and interactive elements based on UX principles, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
                  
                    <p>The inspiration behind the website's informative nature stems from the observation of the lack of clear documentation and abundant data on Datacenters. Hence, my aim was to bridge this knowledge gap in the most user-friendly manner possible.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>

                <h3>Page layout</h3>
                <p>The page layout was kept simple with a navigation followed by a title header and then the body that
                    would one after another display the content boxes. The content boxes were designed to be shuffled
                    using different types of content boxes to prevent the page from becoming a block of text.</p>

            <div class="portfolio-content">
                <div class="portfolio-img rounded overflow-hidden">
                    <img class="img-fluid align-items-center rounded" src="img//HandDrawn/hand1.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-item second padTop">
            <div class="portfolio-content">
                <div class="portfolio-img rounded overflow-hidden">

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>The idea for the navigation was to be fixed at the top for always easy access as well as
                    incorporating a search box which although redundant most of the time would allow for easier access
                    to the search function and allowed for the search function to work even if the user were having
                    issues that prevented them from having one in their browser. This could be the browser not having a
                    search function, their browser-add Ons or software blocking the search function, etc. Furthermore,
                    this search box would work differently, as the regular search function only highlighted text, it
                    would not highlight hidden text that required interaction. Therefore, the search box would be
                    designed in a way where instead of highlighting text that was hidden it would highlight the content
                    box instead.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-item second padTop">
            <div class="portfolio-description">

                <h3>Content boxes</h3>
                <p>The there were three main ideas for the content boxes, the first being a simple image and text for
                    the larger or standalone pieces of information. This type of emphasis the content of the box whilst
                    referencing an image which although not the best option it was better than just plain text. Another
                    type involved an image which when hover over created an overlay with the relevant text. This allow
                    large amounts of text to be hidden de-cluttering the page of items to better adhere to the UX laws
                    of such as millers law which govern that many people can only keep track of around 7 items at a time
                    otherwise, they get confused. The next content box involved the image sliding away to reveal a name
                    or a quick description, this would be rarely utilised as it would fit little text however it would
                    work well for linking an image of an item to its name to give the user better recognition of it.
                    Lastly, I thought of adding videos with continuous playback instead of an image for some of the
                    content. This however fell through later in the project as it would either involve downloading
                    videos which could take up space and make the website load time too long thus not adhering to the UX
                    law of Doherty threshold which dictates that users interact with a webpage at 400ms therefore if the
                    load time exceeded this it could discourage users from using the site. Or, if the images were
                    embedded in an iframe from a source, if the source were deleted the video would not be able to load.

                <h3>Content Layout</h3>
                <p>More information was available on the internet however due to the time provided the research was
                    limited to these topics which were then organized into categories that would be sectioned off making
                    it easier to search though the information.</p>

                <h3>Colour scheme</h3>
                <p>The background colour was kept white without a background image apart from the banner to provide the
                    best contrast possible to the text whose colour was kept black to best contrast the white
                    background. #4169e1 – light blue accents in banner image and progress bar were used to add flair to
                    the page. #b80f0a – dark red was used in the progress bar as it contrasted the blue due to being on
                    opposite on the colour wheel allowing it to transition to provide clear contrast as the user scrolls
                    down the page. #dee2e6 – light white was used in the image overlays to provide better contrast for
                    text when the user hovers over.</p>
